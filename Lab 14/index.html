      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
       All my labs were working just fine but the only one that had a problem was my Lab 3. My lab was not showing and my CSS was not working. 
      </p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>In my Lab 3, my html was not working correctly. It took me a few tries to realize what was wrong and then my CSS wasnt working next. So they created a new Problem</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Below is my lab 3 before I fixed it</p>
