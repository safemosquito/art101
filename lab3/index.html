      <h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
      <p>
        This lab was for us to create files structures and add index.html files
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        I think it was pretty easy since Lab 2 kinda prepare me for this one.
        Learning how to make new index.html files or even having them at the
        right spot so they worked properly was something I kinda done last lab
        so this lab was a refresher!
