        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Assignment was to plan code for a game of choice, of which we picked
            Rock Paper Scissors. After choosing, we were to write the pseudocode
            into an html file, with proper formatting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            In the assignement we didn't really have any problems since we were
            just making comments into code. We would say the one thing we were
            struggling with was coming up with ideas for our games and seeing
            what should come after each steps.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The assignment wasn't too difficult, as it didn't involve any real
            coding. Walter added music into the pseudocode, making it slightly
            more complex, but not at all difficult. Overall, was quite fun!
